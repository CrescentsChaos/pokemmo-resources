    100%: Magmapool☆<br>
    80%: Stealth Rock☆<br>
    67%: Roar<br>
    50%: Iron Defense<br>
    40%: Adaptation <br>

    <h2>Moves:</h2>

    <h2>Note:</h2>
    Damage cap is 4%. <br>
    To beat this fight, you need to create a situation where you have at least one round of pokemon survive a turn to do enough damage to the boss, as well as knock off leftovers. Basically one pokemon per player needs to hit the boss twice. For every additional turn you don’t do damage cap, you need to then create a situation where a mon lives for another turn. Bulk will matter on your attackers. 5x31 may be necessary for some of the team comp. <br>
    <b><u>Adaptation</u></b> <br>
    Makes the boss resistant to whatever type it has been hit by the most. <br>
    <b><u>Weather</u></b> <br>
    If weather is set that is not sun, one use of Magma Storm☆ will remove the weather effect. If no weather is set, another use of Magma Storm☆ will set it to sun. Torkoal is a guaranteed add at the start, while the second is random. This sets sun at the start of the encounter, and then any additional Torkoals that randomly spawn will set sun. <br>
    <b><u>Magmapool☆</u></b> <br>
    An entry hazard which burns everything and does 25% damage. Procs at the end of every turn too. <br>
    <b><u>Stealth Rock☆</u></b> <br>
    Normal Stealth Rock with the added proc at end of turn as well. <br>
    <h2>Strategy:</h2>
    This is my recommendation based on a few things: what mons people might already have, what are usable for other raids, and ease of execution. <br>
    We use mostly fighting types to bait the Adapation to be fighting. There are more bulky Ground/water type abusers so they are more ideal to set up later in the fight. <br>
    On the turn that roar happens, you have a great opportunity to remove hazards via two Defogs. We defog over rapid spin for accuracy to allow for moves like Hydro Pump to be used. <br>
    To satisfy all of these, here is an easily replicable link and team comp that I believe will be able to beat Heatran. Still untested at the time of writing this. <br>
